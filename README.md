# C4 Tabling App

![A screenshot of the tabling app, with C4 logo and text entry fields.](assets/screenshot.png)
This app is a small program to attract new members to the Cornell College Computing Club (C4).
The app relies on the python module `textual` which can be found [here](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).

It displays an ASCII art version of the C4 logo in the Cornell College colors, and it has two text inputs with which student names and emails can be collected.
The names and emails are appended to a comma-separated value file named `tabling_names.csv` each time a name is entered.

When a name is entered, the user will be shown a screen where they can play the arcade game Snake. The user's recorded name, email address, score, and time are written to the comma-separated value file `tabling_scores.csv` each time the game is finished.

Additionally, the user can press the `ESC` key to toggle the display and instead show a QR code for users to scan, so that they can be connected with club resources.
The QR code can be configured and generated by using the `code` subcommand described below.

This app may not appear the same on all terminals. It has only been tested with [KDE Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) 23.04.3 and [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) 0.29.2 on [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) Uranos 23.0.0 so far.

To try it out, simply clone this repository, install `textual` and `segno` with your python package manager of choice, and run `python main.py run`.

## Usage
* `-h`, `--help`: learn more about program arguments
* `-v`, `--version`: display version information for the program

## Subcommands
* `run` - run the tabling app
* `code` - generate QR codes to display in the tabling app

## Usage: Run
Arguments are currently reserved for the Run command but their implementation is not yet finished.
The `run` subcommand will always run the tabling app.

## Usage: Code
* `data`: the data that should be encoded in the QR code.
* `-d DENSITY`, `--density DENSITY`: helps control the final size of the QR code.
    * `1`: 2 characters per bit
    * `2`: 2 bits per character
    * `3`: 6 bits per character
* `-m`, `--allow-micro`: allows generation of Micro QR codes. This option is disabled by default as Micro QR codes are not supported on most mobile phones.


## Dependencies
* [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) is the most critical dependency as it is what this program uses to create the terminal user interface.
* [segno](https://github.com/heuer/segno) is required for the generation of QR codes.
